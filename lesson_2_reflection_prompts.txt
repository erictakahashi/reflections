What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- A bunch of metadata is created to keep track of the files in our repository
- I need to start a repository to start versioning my files and keep control of the changes



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

- The staging area is a intermediate area
	- Directory has all the files
	- And the repository have the commits
- Staging give us more control for commit
	- I can add just some files that I want to be in the commit



How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

- We can use 'git diff' and 'git diff --staged' to see what changes we made
- Knowing what changes we made we can be sure of what is new
- With that we can be sure if what was added is related to a logical change
