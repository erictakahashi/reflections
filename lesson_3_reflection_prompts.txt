When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- When I would like to access my code from anywhere
- If want other people to collaborate, so everybody will access to the code



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- Because I could get an incompleted functionality from someone else
- The last code on remote could conflict with my current work
	- In this case it would be for me to finish my work, and then pull and merge



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- Branch is the creation of a new path from the main stream
	- I can keep the main branch untouched with the stable version
	- And I can create a new experimental feature in another branch
- Clone happens when I make a local copy of a hosted repository
- Fork is like a clone, but a clone only in GitHub context
	- Fork also gives credit to the owner of a repository
	- It's like a "branch" of a repository



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

- We can known how different our local branch is since the last sync action
- We can compare the local branch with the remote changes
- We can work independelly, since the local copy of the remote branch will allow us to merge the branches
