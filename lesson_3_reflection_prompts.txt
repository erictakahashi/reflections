When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- When I would like to access my code from anywhere
- If want other people to collaborate, so everybody will access to the code



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- Because I could get an incompleted functionality from someone else
- The last code on remote could conflict with my current work
	- In this case it would be for me to finish my work, and then pull and merge
